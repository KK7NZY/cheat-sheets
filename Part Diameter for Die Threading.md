Reduce the major diameter of the part being threaded to permit proper crest clearance and avoid seizing the die on the part.

The formula used to calculate the part diameter for die threading is obtained by subtracting the thread pitch $b$ divided by 7.5 from the nominal diameter of the thread $a$.

$\text{Part Diamter}=a-(b\div7.5)$

**Examples**:

Thread: 1/2 - 13 UNC  
Calculation: $0.5-((\frac{1}{13}) \div 7.5) = 0.489$

Thread: M10 X 1.5  
Calculation: $10-(1.5 \div 7.5)=9.8$
