To calculate the linear travel of a thread, you need to know two key parameters: the **pitch** and the number of **rotations**. The pitch refers to the distance between adjacent threads on a screw, and it is usually measured in millimeters per revolution (mm/rev) or inches per revolution (in/rev). The number of rotations represents the number of complete turns the screw or thread makes.

Once you have these two values, you can calculate the linear travel using the following formula:

Linear Travel = $\text{Pitch}\times\text{Number of Rotations}$

Ensure that the units of the pitch and linear travel are consistent (e.g., both in millimeters or both in inches) to obtain accurate results.

For example, let's say you have a screw with a pitch of 2 mm/rev, and it rotates 5 times. The linear travel would be:

Linear Travel = $2\times5=10$

Therefore, the linear travel of the thread in this case would be 10 millimeters.

Below is the most common diameter values, their corresponding diameter in inches, the pitch used, and the linear distance traveled in one rotation.
