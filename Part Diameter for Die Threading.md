Reduce the major diameter of the part being threaded to permit proper crest clearance and avoid seizing the die on the part.

The formula for calculating part diameter for die threading is $a - (b \div 7.5)$, where $a$ is the nominal diamter of thread and $b$ is the thread pitch.

**Examples**:

Thread: 1/2 - 13 UNC  
Calculation: $0.5-((\frac{1}{13}) \div 7.5) = 0.489$

Thread: M10 X 1.5  
Calculation: $10-(1.5 \div 7.5)=9.8$
