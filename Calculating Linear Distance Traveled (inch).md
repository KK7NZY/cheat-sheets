To calculate the linear distance traveled with an imperial thread, you would follow a similar approach as discussed in the section on [[calculating linear distance traveled (mm)]] for metric threads, but with the use of different units of measurement.

In imperial threads, the pitch is typically represented as threads per inch (TPI), which indicates the number of threads in one inch of linear distance. The number of rotations remains the same as before, representing the number of complete turns the screw or thread makes.

To calculate the linear distance traveled, you can use the following formula:

$\text{Linear Travel}=(1\div\text{TPI}\times\text{Number of Rotations})$

Here, ($1\div\text{TPI}$) represents the linear distance traveled per revolution in inches.

For example, let's assume you have an imperial thread with a pitch of 16 TPI, and it rotates 3 times. The linear travel would be:

$\text{Linear Travel}=(1\div16)\times3=0.1875$

Therefore, the linear distance traveled with this imperial thread would be 0.1875 inches.

Below is a table with thread per inch values and their corresponding linear distance traveled in one rotation. Please note the values have been rounded to nearest thousandths.
