#### Imperial

To calculate the pitch diameter of a thread, you typically use the following formula for Unified National (UN) threads:

$\text{Pitch Diameter}=\text{Major Diameter}-(\frac{1}{\text{TPI}}\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$

For example. Pitch Diameter ($PD$) for a 7/8" (0.875 inches) major diameter and a 26 TPI thread, the calculation would be:

$PD=0.875-(\frac{1}{26}\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$
$PD=0.875-(0.0385\times0.866)$
$PD=0.875-0.0334$
$PD=0.8416$

So, the pitch diameter for your 26 TPI thread on a 7/8" shaft would be approximately 0.8416 inches. When boring the mating part for the 7/8" shaft with a 26 TPI thread, you should bore it to match the pitch diameter of the thread on the shaft.

#### Metric

For metric threads, the formula to calculate the pitch diameter of external thread is:

$\text{Pitch Diameter}=\text{Major Diameter}-(\frac{1}{\text{Pitch}}\times0.6134)$

For example, for an M10 $\times$ 1.5 thread (10 mm major diameter, 1.5 mm pitch), the pitch diameter would be:

$PD=10-(\frac{1}{1.5}\times0.6134)$
$PD=10-(0.6667\times0.6134)$
$PD=10-0.409$
$PD=9.591$

So, the pitch diameter for an M10 $\times$ 1.5 thread would be approximately 9.591 mm.
