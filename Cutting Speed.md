It is critical to know the diamter of a material and its Surface feet per minute (SFM or SFPM) to calculate the correct RPM setting.

### Calculating RPM

The formula for calculating RPM is $(SFM\times(12\div\pi))\div d$, where $d$ is the diamter of the material.  For manual machines, the formula can be simplified to $(SFM \times 4) \div d$.  

**Examples**:

- Turning a low carbon steel  5/16" in diamter
  
  $(90 \times 4) \div .3125 = 1152$
- Milling aluminum with 3/8" endmill 
 
  $(150 \times 4) \div .375 = 1600$
- Drilling stainless steel using a 1/4" drill bit
    
    $(40 \times 4) \div .25 = 640$


The calculated RPM is a **maximum**. It is prefereable to run slower and increase RPM as cuts are adjusted. 

On a manual machine it may be necassary to choose an RPM that is closest to the calculated RPM without going over.
