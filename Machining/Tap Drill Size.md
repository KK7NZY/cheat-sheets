It is usually recommended (for most materials) to cut only 75% of a full thread (about a 5% reductions in strength). For tough and difficult to tap materials it is possible to reduce thread height to 60% of a full thread.

Only the thread roots are affected by this height reduction since it is the result of a hole that is larger than the minor diameter (root diameter) of the thread.

The formula for calculating the tap drill size for Unified (imperial) threads (75%) is $a - (1 \div b)$ where $a$ is nominal diamter of thread and $b$ is the bumber of threads per inch.

For metric the formula is $a - b$ where $a$ is the nominal diamter and $b$ is the thread pitch.
